This module wraps all of the 'mpf' (floating point) functions that
the Gnu MP (GMP) library provides. It requires gmp-4.2.0 or later.

You therefore need the GMP library installed on your computer. See:
http://gmplib.org/

To build this module you need perl 5.6.0 or later. I'm not sure of all
the requirements to get it to build with earlier versions of perl, but
it's definite that the XS code relating to operator overloading will
not compile with perl versions prior to 5.6.

No OO interface - just plain access to GMP's floating point functions.

Build in the usual way:

 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test
 make install

When building this module, the GMP library will need to be accessible.
If it's in a location where your compiler does not find it by default,
then instead of running 'perl Makefile.PL', you'll need to run:

perl Makefile.PL INC="-I/path/to/gmp_include" LIBS="-L/path/to/gmp_lib -lgmp"

===================================================
64-bit integer, long double, and __float128 support
===================================================

If your perl's Config reports that 'ivsize' >= 8 && 'ivtype' is not
'long' then Math::GMPf will, by default, be built to enable
you to assign. pass, and retieve 64-bit long long int values.

Similarly, if your perl's Config reports that 'nvtype' is long double,
then Math::GMPf will, by default, be built to enable you to assign,
pass, and retrieve long double values.
Or, ifperl's Config reports that 'nvtype' is __float128, then
Math::GMPf will, by default, be built to enable you to assign, pass
and retrieve __float128 values.

If you have MacPorts installed, you may need to install gmp +universal
for the bindings to work. After installing you'll need to run:

perl Makefile.PL INC="-I/opt/local/include" LIBS="-L/opt/local/lib -lgmp"
